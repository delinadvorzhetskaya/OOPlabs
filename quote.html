When women love us, they forgive us everything, even our crimes; when they do not love us, they give us credit for nothing, not even our virtues. 

To love and win is the best thing. To love and lose, the next best.

Men always want to be a woman`s first love — women like to be a man's last romance

I don’t care what you think about me. I don’t think about you at all.

Work hard to get what you like, otherwise you'll be forced to just like what you get.
